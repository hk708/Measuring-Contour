# Measure and Contour For Iso Rectangles

### :busts_in_silhouette: The Team
* Varun Naryanan
* Anish Sai Mitta
* Himnish Kapoor
* Anurag Sidharth Aribandi

### :key: Run the Project
* Compile the C++ code normally
* The first line of input is n, the number of rectangles, followed by n lines to accept the two x and y values for each rectangle, followed by a 0 or 1 based on whether the contour or measure is to be computed
* The output file generated must be kept in the same folder as the visualisation notebook, which can be run after the C++ code is run to visualize the result.
* The Test_Cases folder contains 6 test case folders in each there is a file with the contour points as output and an input file which has the test case input as well as the values from the input for both contour and measure.
* The Documentation file has the analysis HTML pages.

  
### :books: Libraries Used
* matplotlib for visualisation

### :star: Output
* A contour or measure value will be outputted based on what computation you prompted.
* An output file will be created if contour is chosen with the contour points coordinates.
* The visualization notebook can be run to see the graph of the most recent test case.
